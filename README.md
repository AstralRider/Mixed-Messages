# Codecademy Mixed Messages Project

This project was fairly open ended in its requirements apart from needing to return a random output based on a user input. 

I decided to make a GET request to an API to return a random dad joke each time the user clicked on the button. 

It's not the most responsive design in the world but I didn't want to get bogged down in just writing CSS. My visual design skills are also... well... non-existent.
